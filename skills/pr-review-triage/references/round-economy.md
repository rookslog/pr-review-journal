# Round economy

The rest of this skill is about disposing of a finding *well*. This file is about needing
fewer rounds of them.

**The claim:** round count is a property of the loop, not of the code. A PR that takes eight
reviewer passes is not being reviewed thoroughly; it is being reviewed repeatedly because
each pass fixes sites instead of causes, or introduces the next pass's findings. Treat a
high round count as a defect report against *this skill and your process*, not as evidence
of diligence.

## What counts as a round

A round is one **fix cycle**, keyed to the head SHA — not one reviewer pass. Every review of the
same commit belongs to the same round however many reviewers file it. CodeRabbit, Codex and a
human all reviewing the same head is **round 1**; the round advances when you push a fix batch
and the reviewers come back at the new SHA.

This matters because the budget below is a claim about a *loop*. Counting reviewer passes on a
multi-reviewer PR would trip the tripwire on the third opinion about unchanged code, which is
normal asynchronous review, not a broken loop. If you cannot tell which round you are in, ask
how many times *you* have pushed in response to findings.

## The budget

| Round | What it is for | If it carries substantive findings |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Triage everything the reviewer found | Normal. This is the point. |
| 2 | Confirm the round-1 fixes; catch what the fixes exposed | Normal, and expected — a good fix changes the surface. |
| 3 | — | **Tripwire.** Stop fixing. Run the escalation below. |
| 4+ | — | The loop is broken. You are now generating findings, not resolving them. |

"Substantive" is the observable predicate: **a finding that is not `REJECTED_FALSE_POSITIVE`,
`OBSOLETE`, or a nit you'd have shipped without.** Count them per round; write the count in
the round's summary so the tripwire cannot be reached by not looking.

Nit-only rounds don't count against the budget. Two rounds of real findings then a nit round
is a healthy PR.

## When round 2 is mandatory, and when it is skippable

The budget table calls round 2 "normal, and expected" — but nothing summons it. Auto-review
(where the reviewer's integration enables it) fires once at PR open; every later pass needs a
manual trigger. So the operative question is not "is round 2 allowed" but "who decides to skip
it", and the answer must not be "nobody, by omission".

**Summon round 2 when the fix batch contains judgment no reviewer has seen:**

- Any verdict in the batch is `ACCEPTED_MODIFIED`. By definition you applied a mechanism the
  reviewer did not suggest, so the choice itself has zero reviewer coverage.
- Any fix's diff exceeds the cited finding's scope. Every clustered root-cause fix qualifies
  by construction — a structural change for N findings is bigger than any single suggestion.

**Skip round 2 when CI is already the confirming round:** every verdict is `ACCEPTED` applied
near-verbatim, and every fix carries its own oracle — a test observed to fail before the fix,
a check that either runs or doesn't. Rejections and deferrals never summon a round on their
own: they change no code, and the thread carries the argument.

The principle the mechanics proxy for: **merge only a diff some reviewer has seen, or a
mechanical application of a reviewer's own suggestion with an oracle.**

**The assumption this rests on** is that verdict labels are honest — an adjudicator who wants
to skip round 2 could file a modified fix as `ACCEPTED`. Accepted, because the verdict block
sits beside the diff on the same thread, so a mislabel is publicly checkable: the same
auditability bet the journal itself makes. A mislabeled verdict found in a journal audit flips
this rule to round-2-always.

**Worked case (the omission this section answers).** `rookslog/stylewright` #60, 2026-08-06: a
design document merged after one codex round in which five of fourteen findings were
`ACCEPTED_MODIFIED` — the adjudicator chose among attestation, redaction, and sampling
mechanisms the reviewer had only sketched. No round 2 was summoned, so the artifact's final
judgment calls were its least-reviewed content. The same repo's #59, all-`ACCEPTED` with
per-fix oracles, was correctly merged without one — the condition separates the two cases
where an unconditional rule would not.

## Before you fix anything — read the shape of the round

Do this once per round, before touching code. It costs one pass over the findings and is the
single highest-leverage step in the file.

**1. Tabulate.** Category × locus × depth for every finding:

| Axis | Values | What it tells you |
|---|---|---|
| Category | correctness / concurrency / error-handling / API-contract / test-gap / docs / style | A category that dominates is a *skills* gap, not a code gap |
| Locus | one site / one module / cross-cutting | Cross-cutting means the fix is upstream of every site |
| Depth | surface symptom / structural cause | Surface-heavy rounds predict a round N+1 |

**2. Cluster.** If two or more findings share a root cause, they are **one fix — and still N
verdicts.** Implement the cause once, then dispose of each finding on its own thread with its
own verdict, each citing the shared commit. Resist the pull to apply N suggested patches — N
patches is N chances to introduce round N+1, and it leaves the cause in place to generate more
findings later.

Clustering is about the *implementation*, never about the bookkeeping. `DUPLICATE` means the
**same issue reported at two anchor points** (`verdicts.md`); two genuinely distinct defects
that one change happens to fix are not duplicates, and recording them as such throws away the
per-finding disposition history the journal exists to hold. If each finding would need its own
verification to call it closed, each finding gets its own verdict.

**3. Ask the dominance question — if the round is big enough to ask it of.** A proportion needs
a denominator worth taking a proportion of: on a one-finding round that finding's category is
trivially 100%, and two-item rounds are barely better given how broad the categories are.

- **Four or more substantive findings:** if one category exceeds ~50%, the PR has a systematic
  gap, and the right fix is usually a single structural change plus a test that makes the class
  impossible — not per-site patches. Say so explicitly in the round summary.
- **Fewer than four:** do not compute the percentage at all. Ask the underlying question
  directly — *do these findings have one cause?* — and answer it from the findings themselves.

Dominance is a cheap proxy for the shared-cause question on rounds too big to eyeball, not an
independent test. Both the threshold and the floor are **Conjecture**, like the rest of the
budget.

## The surface-symptom test

This is what the user means by *"the bot is only catching the surface."* Automated reviewers
see the diff. They cannot see the sites you didn't touch, so they systematically report a
class of defect as a single instance.

For every finding, ask one question:

> **What would have to be true for this to be the only instance?**

If you can answer it (the code path genuinely exists once; the convention is enforced by a
type), fix the site and move on. If you cannot, **grep for the siblings the reviewer could
not see**, and fix the class. A finding you fixed at one site and left at three others is a
guaranteed future round the moment those lines enter a diff.

The corollary: a reviewer reporting a *specific* problem has told you where to look, not what
the problem is. Locality of the report is an artifact of the review window.

## Before you push — self-review the fix batch

The largest single source of round N+1 is round N's fix. Automated reviewers re-review the
new diff, so every line you wrote in response is new attack surface, and it was written under
time pressure with the reviewer's framing in your head.

Read your own fix diff as if it arrived from someone else, and answer:

- Does each fix address the cause you identified, or the symptom the reviewer described?
- Did any fix widen a signature, relax a guard, or add a branch that now needs its own test?
- Did I apply a suggested patch whose blast radius I did not actually trace?
- Is there a test that would have caught the original finding? If not, the next refactor
  reintroduces it.
- Would the *same reviewer*, seeing only this diff, file something new?

That last question is the whole exercise. If the answer is yes, fix it now — a round you
prevent costs one grep; a round you incur costs a full review cycle plus a re-triage.

## Fixes that only look like fixes

Two failure modes that produce a *confident* disposition and a next round anyway. Both are
cheap to check and neither is caught by re-reading the diff, which is why they get their own
rule rather than a bullet above.

### A verification that predates the change it covers is not a verification

Running the check, then editing, then reporting the earlier run's result. Nothing about it
feels like skipping verification — you *did* run it, and it *did* pass. But the command you
ran is no longer the command your change produces.

> A ruleset JSON was applied successfully against the live API. A documentation key was then
> added to the same file. The API rejects unknown keys with a 422, so the file could no longer
> be applied at all — and the "verified" claim came from the run before the key existed.

Before writing a verdict that cites evidence, ask: **was this evidence produced by the current
state of the change?** If the fix moved after the check, the check is stale. Re-run it, or
down-label the claim.

The same shape appears in tests: a test written after a fix, which passes, but whose assertion
is dominated by an unrelated code path and would pass with the fix reverted. If a test has
never failed, you have not yet learned anything from it — mutation-check it.

Three steps, and the third is not optional:

1. **Flip the fix off** in the working tree — temporarily, and only the fix under test.
2. **Watch the test fail.** If it still passes, the assertion is not observing your change and
   the test is worthless; rewrite it before going further.
3. **Restore the fix and re-run green** on the *exact* tree you are about to commit.

Step 3 is what stops the check from becoming the defect. A procedure that ends at the red run
leaves the regression reintroduced in the working tree, and the evidence you would cite is a
deliberately broken state. The claim you are entitled to needs both runs: it failed without the
fix, and it passes with the fix, on the tree that ships.

### Loud is not closed

Making a failure *visible* is not the same as making it *not happen*. The fix reports; the
consequence still lands.

> A gate's rule was "any failure must be loud — exit non-zero." But the merge was blocked by a
> published status, not by the job's exit code, so a red run informed the operator while the PR
> stayed green and mergeable. Several fixes written under that rule were weaker than they
> claimed.

For any fix whose mechanism is reporting — a log line, a warning, a non-zero exit, a
notification — name the thing that actually enforces, and check that your signal reaches *it*.
If the enforcing thing never sees the signal, you have improved the diagnostics of an
unchanged bug. That is worth doing, but it is a different verdict, and saying so is what keeps
the next round from finding it.

### A note on clustering

Both of these interact with the cluster rule above: a class is not fixed until **every consumer
of the shared thing** has been checked — not every use inside the file you happened to be
editing. Two files consuming one shared config list is the common case, and fixing one of them
while writing "fixed as a class" is how a closed finding reopens two rounds later.

## Stopping rule

The budget says when a loop is unhealthy; this says when it is **over**. Each clause closes a
gap that kept a real PR running for seven rounds (worked case below).

1. **The conditional re-summon is a round-2 rule.** After round 2, summon a round only if the
   previous round left a *blocking* finding unresolved or newly fixed. Blocking means canonical
   `blocker` or `high` under `docs/design/reviewer-capability-interface.md` §9.1 (Codex P0/P1,
   CodeRabbit Critical/Major, Copilot High, a human's must-fix), from any reviewer, or a finding
   in a risk class the repo declares irreversible (for example double send, wrong paid model,
   data leak, focus theft). A blocker dispositioned `REJECTED_FALSE_POSITIVE` changed no code and
   does not count. `ACCEPTED_MODIFIED` verdicts do not summon round 3+ by themselves; nearly every
   fix chooses its own mechanism, so that condition never terminates.
2. **A round with no blocking finding ends the loop.** Fix its findings in the same push only if
   they touch an irreversible-risk class; otherwise dispose `DEFERRED` with one follow-up issue.
   That issue is the deferral artifact (`verdicts.md`); the reason is the stopping rule itself.
   The fixes' own oracles (failing-then-passing tests) and CI confirm them; no further round.
3. **Escalation does not reset the count.** An escalation at the tripwire that changes the
   implementation (clustering, split, redesign) always gets one confirming round, even when the
   round before it had no blocking finding; that round is N+1. Reviewer calibration alone, with no
   code change, gets none. If the confirming round carries a blocking finding, the PR goes to the
   operator; if not, the loop ends.
4. **Stricter protocol wins.** If the repo or operator sets its own stop ("continue while P1s
   remain; stop at round 4"), apply whichever stops sooner. An operator's maximum is a ceiling,
   not a quota to spend.
5. **Prove the main path first.** A PR that adds a new end-to-end path needs one real end-to-end
   run before round 2 or merge, whichever comes first, or a recorded reason it cannot have one.
   Run it only in an environment the operator has approved for it: a safe integration
   environment, or a live run (one that sends a real message, spends a paid provider or mutates
   production data) with explicit operator approval. Reviewers read diffs; they cannot find what
   only the real environment shows.

**Worked case (2026-10-09, chatgpt-research-adapter PR #100).** Seven Codex rounds, 29 findings,
every one legitimate. All four P1s came in rounds 1–2; rounds 3–7 were P2-only failure-path
edges. The tripwire fired at round 3 and was waved through under an operator cap of round 4, the
redesign arrived at round 5, and the round-2 re-summon condition then restarted the loop twice
more. Meanwhile, the bug that actually broke the product (the provider trims the stored prompt,
so binding refused a correct reply) was found by the first live end-to-end send, not by any
round. Clauses 1, 3 and 5 would each have stopped this loop at round 3.

## At the tripwire (round 3 with substantive findings)

Stop fixing. Write a short note on the PR and pick one:

1. **The clustering was wrong.** Re-run the shape pass across *all rounds together*, not just
   the current one. Usually one cause explains most of what's left.
2. **The PR is too large or does too many things.** Split it. Round count scales worse than
   linearly with diff size, because each round's fixes become the next round's surface.
3. **The design is wrong and review is finding that out one symptom at a time.** This is the
   expensive one and the most common at round 4+. Escalate to a design decision rather than
   continuing to patch.
4. **The reviewer is miscalibrated for this repo** (generic patterns vs. a local convention).
   The fix is repo configuration or a `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` note, not more rounds.

Record which one, with reasons. A tripwire that fires and gets waved through is not a
tripwire.

## Rationalizations that keep the loop spinning

| What you'll think | Why it's wrong |
|---|---|
| "It's only a small fix, I'll just apply it." | Small unclustered fixes are how a round-2 PR becomes a round-6 PR. Cost per round is a full review cycle, not the size of the edit. |
| "The reviewer will catch it if I got it wrong." | Using the reviewer as your test suite is what buys the extra rounds. It is also the slowest possible feedback loop you have access to. |
| "Lots of rounds means it's being reviewed thoroughly." | Thoroughness is findings-per-round-1, not rounds. A high round count means findings arrived late, which means they were cheap to find and you didn't look. |
| "Each round had fewer findings, so it's converging." | Converging on *this* diff. Nothing about a decaying count says the causes were fixed rather than the sites. |
| "I'll cluster after I clear the easy ones." | The easy ones are the evidence for the clustering. Clear them first and you've discarded the pattern. |
| "The tripwire doesn't apply, these are all different." | Then say what the categories are, out loud, in the round summary. If you can't, they aren't different. |

## Red flags

- You applied a suggested diff without opening the surrounding file.
- Two threads got near-identical replies. That is an unnoticed cluster.
- A round's fixes touched files no finding mentioned, and you didn't say why.
- You are on round 3+ and have not written down a category tabulation for any round.
- You resolved a thread whose reply contains no verdict block.
- You reported `0 unresolved` without reading each thread's finding next to its own verdict.
- The PR's diff grew every round.
- A verdict cites evidence from a command you ran *before* your most recent edit.
- A test you wrote for this fix has never been observed to fail.
- You mutation-checked a test and never re-ran it green on the tree you actually committed.
- You recorded distinct findings as `DUPLICATE` because one change happened to fix them all.
- You called a category "dominant" on a round of one or two findings.
- You counted a second reviewer's opinion on unchanged code as a new round.
- The fix's mechanism is a log line, a warning or an exit code, and you have not named the
  thing that actually enforces.
- You wrote "fixed as a class" without listing the consumers you checked.

## Status of this file

Written 2026-07-26 from an operator observation, then exercised the same day against a live
sequence: **26 findings over 9 review rounds on 3 PRs** in `loganrooks/power-toolkit` (#1–#3),
reviewed by `chatgpt-codex-connector`.

What that run supports, as **Observed on one corpus** — one repo, one reviewer, one author, so
treat it as an existence proof rather than a rate:

- Roughly 15 of 26 findings were a **class reported as a single instance**. The
  surface-symptom question found a sibling every time it was asked, including siblings outside
  the diff the reviewer could see.
- Roughly 10 were **self-inflicted** — the previous round's fix authoring the next round's
  finding. This is the mechanism the budget and the pre-push self-review exist for, and it was
  the single largest source of rounds.
- Both rules in *Fixes that only look like fixes* are transcribed from real defects in that
  run, not invented.

What it does **not** establish: the round budget, the 3-round tripwire and the >50% dominance
threshold are still **Conjecture** — the run is consistent with them but did not test them, and
one repo cannot calibrate a threshold.

### The no-guidance control, and where it came from

`writing-skills` asks for a **no-guidance control** before authoring: watch agents fail without
the skill, or there is nothing to fix. That control exists, and it was run by accident.

**Measured.** The plugin build installed and loading during the power-toolkit run was pinned at
`72715c7` (2026-05-25). That commit does not contain this file:

```
git ls-tree -r --name-only 72715c7 -- skills/pr-review-triage/
  skills/pr-review-triage/SKILL.md
  skills/pr-review-triage/references/monitoring.md
  skills/pr-review-triage/references/verdicts.md
```

So the agent that ran those 9 rounds had `pr-review-triage` loaded and had **none** of this
file's guidance from it. The control exhibited the failure the file addresses: ~10 of 26 findings
were authored by the previous round's fix.

**The contamination, stated plainly.** This is not a clean control. The same agent wrote this
file partway through the run, so the later rounds had the reasoning in working context even
though the skill did not carry it. The uncontaminated portion is the rounds that precede
`5b3efd1`; after that point the run is an author dogfooding their own draft. One repo, one
reviewer, one author.

**What that leaves.** The RED phase is satisfied in the weak sense that matters — the failure is
real, observed, and not invented to justify the file. It is *not* satisfied in the strong sense
`writing-skills` intends: no fresh-context agent was given a multi-round PR with this file
withheld, so nothing here is a controlled comparison, and no GREEN result exists at all.

### The deployment arm

Deployed 2026-07-26 as a live dev build (`~/.claude/skills/pr-review-journal-dev` → this working
tree; the pinned `72715c7` install was removed to free the plugin name). Subsequent review cycles
are the with-guidance arm.

Three variables, and they must not be collapsed into one:

| Variable | Measured by | Not measured by |
|---|---|---|
| **Exposure** — was the guidance loaded? | The deployed build (`git ls-tree` the pinned SHA) plus `skillUsage` in `~/.claude.json`. Assigns the arm. | Anything the agent wrote |
| **Adherence** — did the agent follow it? | The round summary carrying a substantive-finding count and a category tabulation | — |
| **Outcome** — did it help? | Rounds to merge, and self-inflicted findings per round | — |

The tempting shortcut is to read the count-and-tabulation as proof the file was loaded. It is
not, in either direction: an agent can produce a tabulation without this file, and an exposed
agent can ignore the file entirely and produce nothing. **Assigning arms by that artifact would
select only the compliant runs into the treatment arm and dump the non-compliant exposed runs
into the control**, which builds the effect it claims to measure. Exposure assigns the arm;
adherence is an observation *within* the arm, and a low-adherence exposed run is a finding about
the skill, not a control.

Baseline at deployment: `pr-review-journal:pr-review-triage` had fired 5 times, all against a
build without this file — so every one of them is control-arm by exposure, whatever its summaries
look like.

`tools/review-journal/` stores per-thread verdicts and reviewers, which is the data needed to
check whether round count tracks cluster-blindness across repos. That measurement has not
been run.
